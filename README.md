This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This repository contains an application developed as a test assignment for the CUE company, as well as an introduction to the React library. 

In this project, I have utilized various React features and concepts including props, dynamic array rendering, conditional content rendering, React.Fragment, useState, memo, portal, and CSS Modules. 

Additionally, Redux has been incorporated into the application, specifically using Redux Toolkit to manage state with the help of state slices and thunk functions. 

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my understanding and implementation of these technologies and concepts while completing the assigned test task and exploring React as a library.

Online saving occurs using Firebase and for simplicity have only one slot.
